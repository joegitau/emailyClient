# Emailyclient

EmailyClient aims to mimick an Email Client, most notably Outlook - both on a visual and functional capacity.
It allows a user to <bold>Signup/ Signin</bold> to the application, then ideally <bold>Send</bold> and <bold>Receive</bold> and <bold>Reply</bold> to emails in real-time.

## About
It is a fullstack* application that uses Angular 2 (v.9.0.1) for the front-end and an OpenSource API for the backend.

## Notable applications
 - Feature Modules     -> Advanced modularity + lazy loading 
 - Reusable Components -> component communication using `Input, Output, EventEmiiters, Services`...
 - Validation          -> Async Validation as well as custom Reactive Forms Validation, e.g - matching fields
 - Resolvers           -> Resolve incomming emails
 - Interceptors        -> Http Errors and Authentication
 - Modals              -> adopting `ElementRef`
